      <description>Really fun branding and web design project with the Division Of/ team for a non-profit running schools in Cambodia. The project won a Communicator Award in the Corporate Identity - Logo category. The logo was inspired by the iconic architecture of Ankor Wat. I was lucky enough to see the signage in person while traveling in Cambodia. You can learn more about Kulen and check out the website design at kulenoutreach.</description>

      <description>As a kid I could spend hours playing this game, so it was an especially fun first React project. Try not to blow up the animals! (Hint: double click to lock mines in place ðŸ”’). If you ever get tired of playing, take a look at the code .</description>

      <description>I made this website to visually explore temporary art exhibits around New York in a digital interface. I used D3 to plot the coordinates of temporary public art exhibits in NYC on a map, loading exhibit information and dynamically fetching an image for each. The static site is hosted on AWS S3. The original architecture for this project ran a Ruby script via a weekly cronjob to update the dataset on Monday mornings.</description>
